# GeM Auto Refresh Chrome Extension 🚀

A lightweight Chrome extension built to prevent **automatic logout on the GeM Portal** due to inactivity by auto-refreshing the page at a user-defined interval.

## 📌 Problem Statement

While working on the **GeM (Government e-Marketplace) Portal**, the session automatically logs out if the page remains inactive for around **15 minutes**.

This causes:
